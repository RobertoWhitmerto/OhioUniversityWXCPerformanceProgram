Pysiological Test Data
    Mass (kg) needed.
    Pace (min/mile) = 3600/Speed(mph), (will be in seconds).
    VO2 - max rate of oxygen consumption during a work out (Liters of oxygen/min) or (mL/(kg*min)),
    RER (Respiratory exchange ratio),
    Heart Rate (bpm),
    GRF-R (BW) (maximal ground reaction force on right leg),
    GRF-L (BW) (maximal ground reaction force on left leg),
    RPE (rated perceived exertion),
    Cycles(steps/min).
    
    Formulas for the charts are from 'Pace Charts and Training Zones,' which 
    are listed below.
    
Volume Summary
    Date, Start Cycle(0 or 1).
    Short Term Average (6 days)
    Long Term Average (30 days)
    Short Term Miles
    Long Term Miles
    Fatigue Index = Long Term Average/Short Term Average
    Training Load = RPE*time

    Speed (mph)
    Pace (min/mile)
    Heartrate = 10.87699*Speed + 56.19444
    RPE = 1.852033*Speed - 3.711416
    Lactate = (0.05711546*Speed^3) - (0.8546505*Speed^2) + (3.056008*Speed) +
              1.390775
    VO2 = 0.3200882*Speed - 0.5437482
    % of VO2 peak = VO2/3.08
    RER = 0.06404704*Speed + 0.350001
    GRF-Right = 0.0842*Speed + 1.8695
    GRF-Left = 0.0842*Speed + 1.8695
    Cycles = 4.7*Speed + 146
    VO2 (ml/kg/min) = (VO2*1000)/mass
